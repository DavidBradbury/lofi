# Known bugs
Bugs:
- When Spotify `listening_to` type is `episode` (videos/music videos), everything breaks. How to handle this? Spotify doesn't even provide artist or track metadata ðŸ¤·
- When Windows Desktop size is not 100%, application window "touchable" area isn't the right size. Drag the window to fix this.

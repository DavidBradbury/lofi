# Lofi: a tiny player
Lofi is a mini Spotify player with visualizations. It is *not* a replacement for the Spotify Desktop app, nor does it play music independently of the Spotify app; but instead, Lofi works alongside it to provide a more intuitive and pleasant access to common features, including pausing/playing, and previous/next track. Lofi also displays cover art and track info stylishly and it facilitates WebGL-powered audio visualizations for both Windows and MacOS. In other words, it's a "tiny Spotify player" or a "mini mode" for the Spotify desktop app.

It is possible to make Lofi work with other audio sources (including YouTube and SoundCloud), and that might make it on the roadmap at some point.
